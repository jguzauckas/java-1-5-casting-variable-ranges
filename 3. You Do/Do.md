# You Do

For each of the following sets of instructions, create a variable with the initial value, print the initial value, and then use compound assignment operators to modify its value, printing out the new result each time.

1. 20.4; Add 10; Multiply by 4.6; Divide by 17.2; Subtract 1; Remainder by 3.8; Add 15.6
2. 5; Multiply 11; Subtract 3; Add 1; Divide by 7; Remainder by 2; Multiply by 6
3. 123456; Multiply 123; Subtract 123; Divide by 1234; Remainder by 123; Add 12345; Subtract 1234

Once you have have implemented all three sets of operations, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
