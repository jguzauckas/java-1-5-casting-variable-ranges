# Understanding Check

In the `Understanding.java` file, try to program the following math "tricks":

Contains the Digits 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8:
- Create an integer variable called containsDigits and pick a number from 1 to 6 to store in it.
- Multiply the variable's value by 9.
- Multiply the variable's value by 111.
- Multiply the variable's value by 1001.
- Divide the variable's value by 7.
- Print out the value of the variable. It should be a number that has the digits 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 in some order.

Six Digits Becomes Three:
- Create an integer variable called sixThree. Pick any 3-digit number and repeat it twice to create a 6-digit number (i.e., 123 becomes 123123), and store it in the variable.
- Divide the variable's value by 7.
- Divide the variable's value by 11.
- Divide the variable's value by 13.
- Print out the value of the variable. It should be the original 3-digit number you had chosen (in my example it would be 123).

Once you have verified that the tricks work, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
