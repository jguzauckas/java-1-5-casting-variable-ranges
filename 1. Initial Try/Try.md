# Initial Try

Using the starting sample code in the `Try.java` file, try to simplify the recursive variable assignments using our compound assignment operators. Leave the original lines and use the blank space underneath each to write the replacement that functionally accomplishes the same thing. When you are done, there should be no more blank lines in the file.

Once you have written the replacements, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
